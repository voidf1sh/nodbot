	content: 'I\'d just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as X-Plane, is in fact, Mods/X-Plane, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, Mods plus X-Plane. X-Plane is not a flight sim unto itself, but rather another component of a fully functioning mod system made useful by the mod HD Mesh Scenery, ActiveSky and vital system components comprising a full sim as defined by the flight sim community.\n\nMany sim users run a modified version of the mod system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of mods which is widely used today is often called “X-Plane”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the mods system, developed by the mod developers. There really is a X-Plane, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.\n\nX-Plane is the platform: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other mods that you run. The platform is an essential part of a sim, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete flight sim. X-Plane is normally used in combination with the mod system: the whole system is basically mods with X-Plane added, or mod/X-Plane. All the so-called “X-Plane” distributions are really distributions of mod/X-Plane.'
